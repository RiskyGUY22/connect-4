# connect-4

A functioning connect 4 game written in pure C, this program was designed for
GNU/Linux based operating systems, but I added windows cross compiling support
to the Makefile. *NOTE* the Windows binary has not been tested so may work as
un-intended.

# Download
    git clone -b master https://github.com/RiskyGUY22/connect-4.git
    cd connect-4

# Build
    make

# Clean
    make clean

The output will be in out/.
