# connect-4

A functioning connect 4 game written in pure C, this program was designed for
GNU/Linux based operating systems, but I added windows cross compiling support
to the Makefile.

_NOTE_ The Windows binary runs but DOES NOT FUNCTION CORRECTLY. Not going to we write the whole code in pro windows format
since I have a Linux version which works.
